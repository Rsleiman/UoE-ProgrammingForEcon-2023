PS1: 10/10, perfect!

PS2: 9.5 out of 10. Excellent job!

PS3: 9.5/10.

PS4: 10/10. Fantastic.

PS5: 6.5/10.  What you've attempted is very good.  I appreciate that this is a very long problem set, and you decided to prioritize.  I'd try to write something for the sections that you didn't do, even if it's just a sketch of how you'd attempt to solve it if you had time.

PS6: 9/10.  Fantastic job, but spend a bit more time on formatting the output to look readable.  

PS7: 6.5/10.  I think you got caught up in the negative utility levels.  That's standard with CRRA utility.  Good attempt, even though most sections don't have code.
